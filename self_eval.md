# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

So far my most proud moment was remembering all of my methods and variables and getting them right almost every time! I needed to tweak a couple of things here and there, but overall I was very pleased with how little I needed to reference my notes for the exercises. 


- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Our methods allow us to be able to call them throughout our code and allow us to be super versatile. We can manipulate a lot of different types of data with one method. 
Each method is different and when we write our own methods we can get a customized outcome with the results we are looking for.
